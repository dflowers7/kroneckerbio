function H = ObjectiveHessian(m, con, obj, opts)
%ObjectiveHessian Evaluate the hessian of a set of objective functions
%
%   H = ObjectiveHessian(m, con, obj, opts)
%
%   Inputs
%   m: [ model struct scalar ]
%       The KroneckerBio model that will be simulated
%   con: [ experiment struct vector ]
%       The experimental conditions under which the model will be simulated
%   obj: [ objective struct matrix n_obj by n_con ]
%       The objective structures defining the objective functions to be
%       evaluated. Note that this matrix must have a number of columns
%       equal to numel(con) (e.g. one objective for each experimental
%       condition is a row vector and multiple objective structures for
%       a single experimental conditions is a column vector).
%   opts: [ options struct scalar {} ]
%       .UseModelSeeds [ logical scalar {false} ]
%           Indicates that the model's seed parameters should be used
%           instead of those of the experimental conditions
%       .UseModelInputs [ logical scalar {false} ]
%           Indicates that the model's inputs should be used instead of
%           those of the experimental conditions
%       .UseParams [ logical vector nk | positive integer vector {1:nk} ]
%           Which kinetic parameters the gradient will be calculated on
%       .UseSeeds [ logical matrix nx by nCon | logical vector nx |
%                   positive integer vector {[]} ]
%           Which seed parameters the gradient will be calculated on
%       .UseControls [ cell vector nCon of logical vectors or positive 
%                      integer vectors | logical vector nq | positive 
%                      integer vector {[]} ]
%           Which input control parameters the gradient will be calculated
%           on
%     	.ObjWeights [ real matrix nObj by nCon {ones(nObj,nCon)} ]
%           Applies a post evaluation weight on each objective function
%           in terms of how much it will contribute to the final objective
%           function value
%       .Normalized [ logical scalar {true} ]
%           Indicates if the gradient should be computed in log parameters
%           space
%       .RelTol [ nonnegative scalar {1e-6} ]
%           Relative tolerance of the integration
%       .AbsTol [ cell vector of nonnegative vectors | nonnegative vector |
%                 nonegative scalar {1e-9} ]
%           Absolute tolerance of the integration. If a cell vector is
%           provided, a different AbsTol will be used for each experiment.
%       .Verbose [ nonnegative integer scalar {1} ]
%           Bigger number displays more progress information
%       .TimeoutDuration [ nonnegative scalar {[]} ]
%           Sets an upper limit to the amount of time an integration may
%           take. Any integration taking longer than this throws an error.
%           If empty (the default), no upper limit is set.
%
%   Outputs
%       H: [ real vector nT ]
%           The sum of all objective function hessians
